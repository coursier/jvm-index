## Usage

Generate the `index.json` index with
```bash
$ GH_TOKEN="****" sbt "runMain writeIndex index.json"
```

## (Non) use by coursier

The index generated here *could* be used by the `java` and `java-home`
commands of [coursier](https://get-coursier.io), but it's not yet.

coursier currently relies on the [index](https://github.com/shyiko/jabba/blob/master/index.json)
from the [jabba project](https://github.com/shyiko/jabba), which is
regularly updated.

The index generated by the script here could either complement, or replace
if needed, the index from jabba at some point.
